A repository is defined within a [project](./project.html) and defines a
connection to a git repository. The git repository contains the Concord file
that defines the workflows and more configuration using the
[Concord DSL](../getting-started/concord-dsl.html)

Repositories are configured within a project in the Concord Console.
