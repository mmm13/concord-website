There are several options to install Concord:

- [Docker](./install/docker.html)
- [Vagrant](./install/vagrant.html)

If you already have access to a Concord deployment or after finishing these
installation steps, you can read the [Introduction to Concord](./index.html)
to understand the basic concepts of Concord or set up your first project with
the [quick start tips](./quickstart.html).
